# The remains of a mistake.

Notus was a Discord bot built by Hexadecimal and Ovyerus while being assisted by sr229, Martmists and Pandentia.

Originally created on December 10th 2016 when Discord Bot creation was at its prime, Notus very quickly died with the rising of
better standards for bots, overly ambitious plans and general "could not be fucked".

Up until now Notus served no purpose other than general reminder on how python code works for Hex and a general bot source that could be
pulled and modified for custom private bots.

Notus also served as public repository for Hacktober PRs, everyone was and still is welcome to PR to it as i will archive the repository on
December 10th 2020 marking the 4 years of the project.

If you want to take the code and fix it, go for it, The license was removed so just do whatever you want, i can't be bothered.
